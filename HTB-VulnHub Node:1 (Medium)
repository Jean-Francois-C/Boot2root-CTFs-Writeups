Walkthrough of the Node:1 HTB-VulnHub VM CTF
========================================================================================================================================

Step 1. Scanning & Enumeration (Nmap + Nikto + Dirb + BURP)
        > SSH (22) and HTTP (3000) 
        > Password hash disclosure for 4 accounts (/api/users, accounts: tom, mark, rastating, myP14ceAdm1nAcc0uNT)

Step 2. Gaining Access
        1. Crack the weak password protecting the admin account "myP14ceAdm1nAcc0uNT" (John + Rockyou.txt)
        2. Log into the website as admin and download a backup file of the website (that it is available for the admin user)
        3. Identify the format of the backup file (Base64 decode + command "file") 
           => it is a protected ZIP archive
        4. Crack the password protecting the backup file (Fcrackzip + Rockyou.txt) 
        5. Find a login/password for a mongodb (mark:5AYRft73VtFpc84) hardcoded in a script (/var/www/myplace/app.js)
        6. The mongodb credentials are valid for the linux server (password re-use / misconfiguration)
           => Log into the Linux server as the low-privileged user "mark"
          
Step 3. Post-exploitation - Linux enumeration (scripts: "LinEnum.sh" & "Linux-exploit-suggester.sh")

Step 4. Privilege escalation to root

        Method 1
        --------
        => CVE-2017-16995 - "eBPF_verifier" privilege escalation exploit (exploitdb)
        
        Method 2 (Insecure scheduler "/var/scheduler/app.js" + SUID binary "/usr/local/bin/backup")
	      --------
        1. Identify that the scheduler "/var/scheduler/app.js" is executing code contained in the Mongodb "scheduler" database tasks
        2. Log into the mongodb database with the credentials previously found (mark:5AYRft73VtFpc84) and create a malicious task / backdoor
        3. Gain a shell as the privileged accout "tom" which is running the scheduler
        4. Identify that the user account "tom" is member of the group "admin" and that it can execute a (root) SUID binary "/usr/local/bin/backup"  
        5. Analyze the SUID binary "/usr/local/bin/backup" and understand how it works (command "strings" + tests + info in the script "/var/www/myplace/app.js")
        5. Use the SUID binary "/usr/local/bin/backup" to backup the file /root/root.txt :-)
